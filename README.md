# Casse-pere

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/albanleandri/hugo-casse-pere.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/albanleandri/hugo-casse-pere)

## History
[Casse-pere](https://github.com/albanleandri/hugo-casse-pere) is based on [Chaschper](https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper).

Thank you to Jens-Christian Fischer for his work on [Chaschper](https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper). Chaschper is based on [Casper Two](https://github.com/eueung/hugo-casper-two), a port of the [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), the default personal blogging theme for Ghost. A legacy version (v1.x) has [already been ported](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper) to Hugo years ago.

With Casse-pere, I tried to organize things in a way that suited me better.

* Moved the navigation bar on top of the page
* Added the Whatsapp, LinkedIn and Email share buttons to the floating header
* Added support for Google Tag Manager
* Added ability to toggle on/off the search feature, logo footer, author signature in posts
* Show post description in list instead of full untruncated content
* Removed the "archive" content type
* Decoupled the word count and the read time, so I can show only read time in articles
* Fixed some screen width responsivity issues arout the 900px breakpoint
* Removed Matomo, as Google Analytics is free, and suited me

Sample content structure is given in the `exampleSite` folder. Have fun!

### Search

The forked themes had a search function. It must be toggled on, in order to be visible in the navigation bar.
It uses [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for a site specific search, provided you have set the `domain` parameter in your `config.toml` file

To get DuckDuckGo to index your domain, submit it to the 
[Yandex Webmaster Tools](https://webmaster.yandex.com) -
after a few days, DuckDuckGo will have picked up the domain and the pages indexed by Yandex.

## Image Galleries

Create a directory called "galleries" in your `content` directory. Add a directory for each 
gallery and place the images in it. Add `index.md` (otherwise it will not work) with a
description (optional) and the following front matter:

    ---
    title: "Scuol 2018-10-25"
    date: 2018-10-25T15:26:46+01:00
    tags: ["scuol", "autumn"]
    type: "gallery"
    ---
    
    A wonderful, sunny day in Scuol in autumn. Pictures taken during a walk down to the Inn river.

The galleries will mix in with your regular posts and there is
a `/galleries` path that lists all of them in reverse chronological order.

Uses [Fluidbox](https://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/demo/index.html) to display images.
