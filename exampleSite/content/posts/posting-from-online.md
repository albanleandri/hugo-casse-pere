Having a git based blog makes it slightly 
difficult to post while on the go. 
I have read at least two [accounts](https://schnuddelhuddel.de/switching-from-wordpress-to-hugo/)  of people who pulled that off, but neither workflow quite worked for me.

Here's where I'm at:

* use [WorkingCopy](https://workingcopyapp.com) to clone this sites [jcfischer/invisible_ch](https://github.com/jcfischer/invisible_ch) repository 
* Using [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) to edit files that are stored in A git repository (add WorkingCopy as a file provider in iA Writer)

Things I tried that didn't work: 

* using [Git2Go](https://git2go.com/) - app not available on Swiss AppStore. Update: Actually the app is no longer 
  on the AppStore at all, [said the developer](https://twitter.com/pietbrauer/status/1081158855608946688)
* using [Editorial for iOS](https://omz-software.com/editorial/) to edit posts. Looks nice, but crashes when trying to open a file from WorkingCopy (also not adapted to iPhone X screen)

Will update this post as I learn more.
