From the outside, creating compelling blog posts might appear simple. Even the best writers out there have had to build their skills. It took them practice methodology. Only when we work at it, again and again, we eventually get good.

The whole deal is about learning to create engaging content readers want to interact with. Anybody can write meaningless fluff, but compelling material… That’s another story.

Luckily, writing engaging content is like other crafts for it’s simpler to learn when you help yourself with the right methods and tactics. No matter what type of content you plan to create, follow the steps below, and you'll end up with high-value content that gets your brand noticed.

## **1\. Curate content & figure out what questions resonate with your readers**

One of the very first steps to writing useful content is learning to curate it. Content curation is the process of gathering information relevant to a particular topic or area of interest. Services or people that implement content curation are called curators. What’s more, discovering what are the “hot topics” and “industry trends” plays a crucial role to understand the needs of your audience.

“Start curating content and add your unique commentary or perspective on the article. You want to create a valuable content experience for your audience.”

Writing engaging content means answering readers' questions, so you have to know what they are. Polling readers or searching through Q&A sites or keywords planners can be very useful.

> Quora or Stack Overflow are great places to start. These platforms abound of user-generated questions, well-organized by topics.

Once you’ve found some questions you think would resonate with your readers, turn them into blog posts.

Your competitors are a great source of content ideas. Comb through the comments of a competitor blog. Take note of unanswered questions and run with them on your blog.

Browse through a competitor website and take note of what you see, what you don’t have. These observations will be your future opportunities.

Are there topics nobody is talking about in your industry? If so, address them head-on.

> When you dare to write about what your competitors won’t, you become a thought leader in your industry.

Topics you discover this way don’t have to be anything crazy. It can be anything. Just keep your audience in mind.

Imagining that your reader is standing right there in front of your computer, and you’re talking to them directly. Do you have anything interesting to tell them?

## **2\. Build the backbones, then fill the blanks**

Before you start hitting your keyboard frantically, you must know which points you want to cover, and in what order, preferably. For that, create an outline, nothing more than bullet points with all the relevant sections that should appear in the post for you to consider the blog complete.

Now that you have your outline/template, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your outline as a guide and be sure to expand on all of your points as needed.

If you find you're having trouble stringing sentences together, you're not alone. Finding your "flow" can be challenging for a lot of folks. Luckily, there are a ton of tools you can lean on to help you improve your writing. Here are a few to get you started:
